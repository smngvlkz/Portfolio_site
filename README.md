# My Portfolio Site. 

This is a portfolio site that aims to showcase some of my projects as a junior full stack developer. It was built using HTML, SCSS/CSS, and Javascript. It also uses the Github API to fetch and display github repositories.

You can view the live version of the site here - https://smngvlkz.netlify.app/

## Overview

I structed the site especially the projects page to redirect directly to each specific Github repo so that anyone who is interested in viewing them first see how my code and all the documentation related to the project.
Of course each project that is included in the site is live and has it own URL in its specific repo, but I specifically chose to redirect to Github soley because I want to showcase my code first before you experience the app.

I will include more projects in the future and some I will also remove as I get better and better at my job.

I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
